Bundle-GMOD version 0.01
========================

The Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project (http://www.gmod.org) is
a collection of software for running a model organism database.  This bundle
is the minimum required for getting the schema installed in a PostgreSQL
database and running the Generic Genome Browser (http://www.gmod.org/ggb)
on it.  Other modules may be required for other components of GMOD.
